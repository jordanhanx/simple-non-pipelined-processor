## ECE550 Projects 2022 fall


This GitHub repository contains the course project for ECE550, which focuses on designing a non-pipelined CPU based on the MIPS ISA using Verilog. The project is broken down into several steps, each of which is documented in the repository. The initial steps involve designing individual components such as the ALU and register file, while the later steps involve integrating these components to create the complete CPU design. The repository contains Verilog code for each step, as well as testbenches to verify the correctness of the design. Additionally, please rate if my clock design is smart enough.
